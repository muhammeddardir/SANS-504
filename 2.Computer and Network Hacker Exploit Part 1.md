### Reconnaissance
- Helpful step for experienced Attackers to gather information

**OSINT : Lab 2.1 OSINT with SpiderFoot**
- All organization have a lot of data online
- OSINT : is the collective representation of this data in useful manner.
- Examples for tools :
	- whois
	- Reverse whois
	- Certificate Transparency : An ecosystem that makes the issuance of website certificates **transparent** and **verifiable**. and detect malicious website [entrust](https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui)
	- have I been pwned
	- SpiderFoot
**DNS Interrogation**
- nslookup : used to interact with DNS server get data.
- DNS Zone Transfer "DNS Active Interrogation"
- DNS Recon Defense : 
	- Preparation : Don't allow zone transfer from just any system, Use DNS Split
	- Identification : Look for DNS zone transfer logs
**Web Site Search**
- Search the target's own web site
- pushpin : Social media geolocation, and google photo metadata
**Search Engines as Recon Tools**
- GHDB
- DORKS
- wayback machine
- Foca : is a tool used mainly to find metadata and hidden information in the documents it scans.
- Google web master tools
**Maltego Recon Suite**
**Web-Base Recon and Attack Site**

### Scanning

**War Dialing**
-  Is a technique where an automated tool dials a range of phone numbers looking for modem connections. It's often used to identify vulnerable systems for unauthorized access.
- Good for Out-Band communication for example (for example remote access to routers)
- War-VOX war dialing : using one or more VOIP not required hardware.
- Defense Page 68 and 69
**War Driving**
- War driving is an attack technique where individuals drive around with a mobile device, typically a laptop or smartphone, to locate and exploit vulnerable or open wireless networks, e.g. Wi-Fi.
- Two Scanning Method :
	- Active : Send frequent probe request message for all SSID observing Response
	- Passive : listen for beacons sent frequently by the AP disclosing the SSID, encryption, and auth support option
- inSSIDer Tool from metageek : use Active and Passive scanning with standard WI-FI card on windows, Identify SSID, Security setting and Channel info with GPS Location mapping. 
- Kismet : Passively Captures WI-FI activity, Prevented any Opportunity for discovery
- Attacking PSK Wi-Fi : authentication
- Wi-Fi Network Imposters : easy way for attackers to exploit Wi-Fi, for hotspot and guest network 
- `/neighbor.sh wlan0 eth0 asciiImage.p1` 
- `./hostapd-wpe hostapd-wpe.conf`
- Defense page 88-90
**Lab 2.2 Wireless LAN Discovery**
**Network Mapping with Nmap**
- Attacker use it to understand Network as DMZ and Internal.
- Traceroute by TTL
- Defense : 
	- Preparation : Disable ICMP Echo Request, and ICMP time exceeded
	- Identification : IDS Signature.
	- Containment : Block Source IP
**Port Scanning with Nmap**
- TCP/UDP
- Three way handshake 
- OS fingerpainter
- `Masscan 10.0.0.0/8 -p 22,25,80,443,3389`
- Remux.py : Connected throw the proxy
- Defense : 
	- Preparation : Closed unused port
	- Identification : IDS Signature.
- Check listening port in windows : `netstat -nab`
**Lab 2.3 NMAP**
**Evading IDS/IPS**
- Many IDS/IPS don't validate the TCP Checksum, Attacker can insert a TCP Rest with invalid checksum to clear IDS/IPS buffer, Target System drop any packet with an invalid TCP Checksum
- Defense :
	- Preparation : keep IDS/IPS Up to date
	- Identification : IDS included heavy fragmentation overlapping TCP segments 
**Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus**
- Defense : 
	- Preparation : close all unused port and Patch system
	- Identification : system signature
**Lab 2.4 Nessus**
**SMB Session**
- Client Windows Tools : net use, reg, sc, PsExec
- Client Linux Tools : SmbClient, Smbmount, rpcclient.
- Shardview Tool : Domain Enum
- PowerShell Empire : Backdoor Build-in PowerShell
- Bloodhound
- Learn How to Seeing and Drop Session by `net use` 
- Defense : 
	- Preparation : Block Access ports : TCP/445, UDP/445, TCP/135, TCP/137, UDP/138, TCP/139
	- Identification : Check for access listed port and IDS alerts

**Lab 2.5 SMB Session**
