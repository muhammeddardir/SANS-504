### Overview
**Incident Handling**
- Is an action plan for dealing with the misuse of computer system and computer network such as :
	- Intrusions
	- Malicious code infection
	- Cyber theft
	- DOS
	- Other security related events
- Incident vs Event 
	- Event : Any observable occurrence within a system or organization.
	- Incident : A significant, negative event requiring a coordinated response.
- Incident Handling vs Incident Response
	- Incident Handling : The overall process of preparing for, managing, and recovering from security incidents.
	- Incident Response: Immediate actions taken to contain and mitigate a security incident.
***
### Incident Handling Process
1. Preparation : Steady State 
2. Identification : Declare incident 
3. Containment : Start cleanup
4. Eradication : Finish cleanup
5. Recovery : Back in product
6. Lesson Learned : Done
***
### Preparation
**The goal of preparation is to get the team ready to handle incidents**
- People : Sans, Attacker can perform attack on people as Phishing and via calls "Social Engineer"
- Policy : Warning Banners and Response Strategies, Notify Law Enforcement, 
	- **Tool GRR** : has ability to pull in-depth forensics artifacts from multiple systems  
- Data 
- Software and Hardware
- Communication
- Supplies
- Transportation
- Space
- Power and Environmental Control
- Documentation
***
### Identification, Have Lab 1.1
- Assign handler 
- Control the flow of information
- Communication Channels : 
	- If computer are compromised avoid using it for (emails and chat)
	- Use Telephone and fax 
	- Be carful when use VOIP can be sniffed by Wireshark.
	- Check team use encrypted emails such as GunPG, PGP, S/MIME and so on  
	- Possible encrypted cloud storage such as tresorit or securesafe
- Where dose identification occur? : Identification can happen anywhere in env as :
	- Network Perimeter detection : FW, Router, IDS/IPS, DMZ Systems, etc.
	- Host Perimeter detection : occur when data enters or leaves host : Personal FW/IPS, local firewall, port sentry tools as Backdoor Open in host. detect by netstat `netstat -naob|more`, to show process to listen to ports for backdoor
	- System Level (host) detection : host it self, Antivirus, endpoint security tools
	- Application level detection : App logs (web app, app server, cloud service)
- **Suspicious Events Cheat Sheets**
	- For windows one sheet and linux also : I download it in this directory
	- I'm Create Mindmap For windows CheatSheets
- **Windows Cheat Sheets Elements**
	- Look for unusual : Process and Services, Files, Network usage, Schedule task, Account, Log entries, Others unusually items and Additional Supporting (third party) tools  
***
### Containment
**Deploy Containment**
- Deploy small on-site team to survey the situation "Identification Team" can doing it by sans Incident Forms
**Characterize Incident**
- Incident Category
	- DOS, Compromised Information, Compromised Asset, Internal Hacking, External Hacking, Malware Policy violations
- Criticality (affects response time)
	- Level 1 : Business critical system, 60-minute response time
	- Level 2 : Non-Business critical system, 4-hour response time
	- Level 3 : Possible incident, non-Business critical system, 48-hour response time
- Sensitivity (affects who should be notified)
	- Level 1 : Extremely sensitive (CSIRT, Management) 
	- Level 2 : Sensitive (CSIRT, Management, system owner and operator)
	- Level 3 : Less Sensitive (CSIRT, affected employees)
**Containment Components** 
1. Short-Term Containment
	- Definition : Stop attacker progress without making any changes to the impacted system itself, until take image backup to back it up.
	- Actions : 
		- Disconnect network Cable
		- Pull the power cable : not recommended
		- Using network management tool, Isolated switch port
		- Apply filter to Router and/or Firewall
		- Change DNS name to a different IP
		- For External Attacks : Coordinate with ISP
	- You Should use WordWebBugs to track the attacker
	- Create forensics image
	- write Blocker and Drive Duplicators
2. Long-Term Containment
	- Definition : Might change the drive image of the impacted system, That's OK because we have already your backup for forensics analysis
	- Ideal : If the system can be kept offline, move to the eradication Phase
	- If less than Ideal, if system must be kept in product, perform long-term Containment action.
	- Actions : 
		- Patch the system and possible neighboring system
		- Insert IPS or in-line snort/Suricata
		- Null Routing
		- Change Password
		- Alert Trust Relationships
		- Apply firewall and router filter rule
		- Remove account used by attackers, shutting down backdoor process
	- You still need to eradication
	- The Idea for Long-Term : is to apply temporary Band-Aid to stay in production, while you are building a clean system during eradication  
***
### Eradication
- Resorting from backup : select backup that taken before infection
- **In case rootkit that modifying in OS itself and Removing Malicious Software as viruses, backdoors, rootkit, etc., we can doing:** 
	- Wipe the drive (zeroing it out)
	- Reformat the drive
	- Rebuild system from the original install media 
	- Apply Patch
- Improve Defenses 
	- Apply filter to Router and/or Firewall
	- Moving the system to the new name/IP
	- Null Routing Particular
	- Change DNS name
	- Applying Patches and hardening system
- After Eradication : Perform vulnerabilities analysis  
***
### Recovery
- The Goal  of Recovery Phase is to put the impacted system back into production in safe manner.
- After Recovery Always as for test plan and baseline documentation
- Recovery/Restore Operation must be in off-hour time
- Monitor Systems
- Locking for artifacts to come back
***
### Lesson Learned
- Report : document what happen
- Meeting
- Apply fixes : Fix (your process, technology, Improve incident handlining), Root Cause analysis
***
### Enterprise Wide IR, Have Lab 1.2
**Ingress and Egress Data**
- When incident occur our responder ask for logs for egress connections from "FW, DNS cache, DNS logs and any external web filtering device as Proxy"
1. Web Proxy
	- Detect Compromised host connect with C2
	- Review length of URL 
	- Useragent
2. DNS Cache
	- Reveal Systems that are connected to known bad IP and Domain
	- DNS Blacklist is Python script to identify : Created by ethanr
		- Feeds it DNS Logs, anything with IP and Domains : List all malicious hosts
		- Use Regular Expression
	- Malware Domain : List is great site for updated list of known bad actors
3. Connection log
	- NetFlow : Detect becoming and TTL 
***
### Applied Incident Handling
1. **Espionage تجسس**
2. **Unauthorized Use**
3. **Insider Threats**
4. **Legal Issue and Cybercrime Laws**
5. **VMware and linux**
